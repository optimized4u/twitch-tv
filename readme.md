# Twitch User Streams

A project created as part of my FreeCodeCamp course.

The app holds an array of users and checks with the Twitch API to find their broadcasting status.

Results from the API queries are displayed as follows:

Color: Green:
If the user is online they are added to the results list, including information about their stream and a link to their page.

Color: Yellow:
If the user is offline they are added to the results list, marked as 'Offline' and a link added to their page.

Color: Red:
If the user is not found they are added to the results list and marked as 'User Not Found'
